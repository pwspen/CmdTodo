Minimalist command line todo list program focused on ease of use and configurability

Allows for addition, completion, deletion, editing of tasks

Allows for multiple different todo lists (each is a json file)

Calculates urgency of tasks using assign date, due date (function is user-settable)

Logs completed tasks in csv, allows for export of current tasks in json and csv

todo (how ironic):
- [ ] user-set urgency funcs
- [ ] argument sanitization
- [ ] more history logging
- [ ] help function auto-generation
- [ ] tutorial / example
- [ ] more visualization
- [ ] startup commands
- [ ] category persistence
- [ ] category sort, non-task cats
